# EmbeddedTrEE

Two main parts, embedded code and webcode

The embedded code is the python, which sends the acceleration and microhpone data and receives info on whether to turn its led on or off.

The webcode receives the data and graphs it, as well as deciding whether the led on the device should be on or off. Currently, it turns it on if there is a period of sustained activity, but obviously this could be extended.

It was tough to find a truly original use for the accelerometer, but we think that our application has managed to do that. Using a dog as a sesnor for an alarm is really unbeatable, as its difficult to fool a dog, but currently dogs have no way to signal that something bad is happening. Our device solves that, and with the addition of a camera and a integration into a home security network, it provides a complete home security solution.
